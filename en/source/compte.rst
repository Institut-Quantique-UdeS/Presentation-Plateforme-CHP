   Access to the IQ HPC Platform is governed by the `politique d'accès aux
   calculateurs
   <https://www.usherbrooke.ca/iq/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Politiques-Calculateurs-haute-performance-HPC-2022-06-02.pdf>`_.

Getting access to the IQ HPC Platform is a two-step process:

1. Create a `CCDB <https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/>`_ account.
2. Fill out the `annexe C de la politique d'accès aux calculateurs
   <https://forms.office.com/r/UKb6yPneD1>`_.
3. Subscribe to our :doc:`mailing list <aide/liste>`.

Creating a CCDB account
-----------------------

If you do not already have a CCDB account, you must `create one
<https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/account_application>`_ to access the IQ HPC
resources. Your CCDB account also gives you access to the Alliance clusters.
If you are not a faculty member, your access must be sponsored. Ask your
supervisor for his or her CCDB CCRI (role identifier, in the form abc-123-45).
You need this information to identify your sponsor when you register.

     (Alliance technical documentation)

..
    Alternative: restricted account
    -------------------------------

    If you cannot create a CCDB account (no sponsor can give you access), you can
    get a restricted IQ HPC account instead. To do so, write to our :doc:`technical
    support <aide/support>`, including the following information:

    - Full name
    - Desired username
    - Public SSH key (optional)

    We will create your account with a temporary password that you must change when
    you connect to the platform for the first time.
